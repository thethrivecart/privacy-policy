  <h1>Privacy Policy for Email Cleanup Assistant</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 18 May, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>Email Cleanup Assistant</strong> is a Chrome extension developed by The Thrive Cart. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your data. This policy explains how our extension accesses, uses, and protects your information.</p>

  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    The extension only requests access to your Gmail account using the following scopes:
    <ul>
      <li>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly</li>
      <li>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify</li>
    </ul>
    This access is used to retrieve metadata and content of emails (subject, sender, label) for the sole purpose of identifying promotional, unread, or spam messages for deletion or blocking. No email content is stored, logged, or transmitted to any external server.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Use of Permissions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>OAuth2 Authentication:</strong> Used only to securely authenticate your Gmail account through Google.</li>
    <li><strong>Gmail Readonly & Modify Scopes:</strong> Allow the extension to read and delete emails locally from the browser to assist in inbox cleanup. Emails are not shared or stored outside the browser environment.</li>
    <li><strong>Identity Scope:</strong> Required to verify your Google account and initiate secure access.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Security & Protection</h2>
  <p>
    The extension does not collect or store any user data. All interactions with Gmail data occur within your local browser using HTTPS-secured requests to Google's official APIs. We do not use intermediate servers or third-party services for processing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Gmail data is only held in memory temporarily during your active session and is discarded immediately after the operation completes.
  </p>

  <h2>4. No Third-Party Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    Your Gmail data is never shared, transferred, or sold to any third party or external service provider.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We do not store or retain any Gmail data. The extension is stateless and operates fully on the client side.
  </p>

  <h2>6. User Control</h2>
  <p>
    You can revoke this extensionâ€™s access to your Gmail account at any time through your Google account permissions: <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank">Google Account Permissions</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
  <p>
    If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or your data, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:thethrivecart.ltd@gmail.com">thethrivecart.ltd@gmail.com</a>
